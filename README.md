# CS study guide

I have alway wanted to learn computer science and understand a lot of concept so i can easily develop low level tools and efficient packages by myself or with other developers.

This guide i am using is an extension of the guide from www.teachyourselfcs.com , wish myself luck in this study.
I dont want to go back to school anymore to study CS, so i am taking the effort to learn it personally

## Topics
There are 9 topics in focus for me to become a solid computer engineer. The topics include 

1. Programming
2. Computer Architecture
3. Algorithm and Data structure
4. Maths for CS
5. Operating systems
6. Computer networking
7. Databases
8. Languages and compilers
9. Distributed systems


## How this study will work
This is to ensure effective study as i am working with a startup. The study flow runs like:

> Study chapter -> Review notes -> Work on any possible short project or homework -> Review notes again -> blog on twitter(no hashtags) -> Next chapter



## Why i should study computer science

> There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools.

>Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers progress toward more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.


> Type 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. Type 2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.
